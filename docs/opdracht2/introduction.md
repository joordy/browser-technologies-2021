# Break the web

## Assignment

Breaking the Web by deliberately turning off features of the platform. Images, custom fonts, JavaScript, color, broadband internet. The purpose of this assignment is to find out that you may have assumptions that are incorrect and to empathize with the end user.

Research at least two features. That means figuring out how it impacts the sites you know and normally use. Find out how to test the feature. Choose sites in your immediate area: from your employer, local association, the cafeteria around the corner, and / or previous projects you have done yourself. Investigate the problems, numbers and / or opinions. Also think about how you could solve the problems.

1. Turn off images
2. Disable custom fonts
3. Plot color & set color blindness

5. ** _ Turn off broadband internet _ **
6. ** _ Javascript (full) _ **
