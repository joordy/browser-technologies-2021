# Browser Technologies

## üî¶ **Case**

For the final assignment it is important to develop an interactive application according to the principles of Progressive Enhancement. It must be ensured that the users, on all browsers, and in every possible context can use the interactive application. The most enhanced version is 'pleasurable', so that it is good and pleasant for the user to use.

### **Nerdy T-Shirt**

I want to be able to design my own t-shirt with nerdy text, save it, order it, and use it next time I visit the site.

- Data maker (name, telephone or email)
- Color t-shirt
- Text t-shirt
- Size t-shirt
- M / F
- Pick up where you left off / revise design
- Validation: everything must be completed. Provide clear error messages
- User must be able to create and revise multiple t-shirts, so must have an overview page.
- Order page to buy a design and have it made
