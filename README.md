## 🔦 **Case**

### Nerdy T-Shirt

I want to be able to design my own t-shirt with nerdy text, save it, order it, and use it next time I visit the site.

- Data maker (name, telephone or email)
- Color t-shirt
- Text t-shirt
- Size t-shirt
- M / F
- Pick up where you left off / revise design
- Validation: everything must be completed. Provide clear error messages
- User must be able to create and revise multiple t-shirts, so must have an overview page.
- Order page to buy a design and have it made
