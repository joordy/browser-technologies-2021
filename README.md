# Browser Technologies

## üî¶ **Case**

For the final assignment it is important to develop an interactive application according to the principles of Progressive Enhancement. It must be ensured that the users, on all browsers, and in every possible context can use the interactive application. The most enhanced version is 'pleasurable', so that it is good and pleasant for the user to use.

### **Nerdy T-Shirt**

I want to be able to design my own t-shirt with nerdy text, save it, order it, and use it next time I visit the site. [_criteria_](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web/browser-technologies-2021/blob/master/course/Usecase-t-nerdy-shirt.md)

## üåê **Live link**

Live application: [shirtdesigns.app](https://shirtdesigns.herokuapp.com/)

## **Browser tests**

- Brave browser (Chromium, on MacOS)
- Safari (Non-Chromium, on MacOS)
- Safari (iOS on iPhone 12 pro)
- Chrome (on Samsung A50)
- Default Samsung Browser (on Samsung A50)

## üöÄ **Progressive Enhancements**

Progressive Enhancement is a way of building websites and web-applications. It is based on the theory that your page should work with just the basic layer, before adding any other layers. The HTML layer will be rock-solid, and will still work if any of the enhancements doesn't load or aren't supported.

### **Enhancements**

#### **Live form input**

As a JavaScript enhancement I added a live form input, which means that the text that the user passes on, what they want on the shirt, is shown on the shirt in real time. This gives you as a user an idea of what the product will look like.

#### **Changing shirts**

When the user has chosen a specific color for his or her t-shirt, it is immediately displayed to the user using JavaScript. This makes it immediately clear what color the user has chosen.

#### **Custom form validation**

By disabling the standard form validation of HTML with javascript, and writing his own patterns for this, the user is obliged to write specific information in the input fields. For example, a name must match at least 2 characters, and an e-mail address must contain a '@' and '.'.

#### **Local Storage API**

With the help of local storage, it is possible for the user to, once they have designed a shirt and sent it to the confirmation page, all information is stored in the local storage, so that they can come back here at a later time. to continue working with them. The local storage is emptied when the shirts are ordered.

### **Layers**

<details style="margin: 1em 0;">
  <summary style="margin: 1em 0; font-weight: 700;">Functional</summary>

- HTML content works properly
- User can order t-shirt using form
- User can log in to add shirt to profile

The functional/Reliable layer only contains HTML. The site doesn't look that nice, but it will still work for the user. He can still customize a nerdy T-shirt and order it. The core functionality still works, but isn't that lovely to see.

</details>

<details style="margin: 1em 0;">
  <summary style="margin: 1em 0; font-weight: 700;">Reliable</summary>
  
  - Form validation works, user can't make small mistakes

The reliable layer is still pure html, but every HTML will be supported by the browser. For example, the images can be viewed and other html elements, such as `<details>`, are supported by the browser. Although it is not yet perfect. Some important elements are missing, so the website is not yet missing works optimally. Also the basic styling will be added, not every browser supports grid or flex-box, so it will be displayed as blocks. The form will be validated with the basic HTML validations, such as required, and correct type of E-mail address.

</details>

<details style="margin: 1em 0;">
  <summary style="margin: 1em 0; font-weight: 700;">Usable</summary>

- CSS adds extra styling

The usable layer is easy to use for the customer. All the HTML elements will be styled. The browser supports all the CSS selectors, and will add grid or flex-box to the layout. It already looks way better than the reliable layer, and is usable for the customer. Also buttons will be disabled when they aren't in use.

</details>

<details style="margin: 1em 0;">
  <summary style="margin: 1em 0; font-weight: 700;">Pleasurable</summary>

- Print will be displayed on shirt
- User can remove shirt by using swipe gestures on phone

The pleasurable layer contains functions that aren't necessary, but fun to use for the customer. There is a live input for the t-shirt, to display the print-text, directly on the t-shirt. Also the image of the t-shirt will be changed to the selected color. There is also a form validator which checks if you fill in a correct user ID, e-mail address, print and names. Not necessary, but definitely helpful. Also, when a customer designed a t-shirt, placed it in the shopping cart, and comes back later, the filled in details of this specific shirt will be stored on the product page.

</details>

## **Feature detection**

### **CSS Feature detection**

In CSS you can use feature detection with the `@supports` syntax. By using this syntax you can ensure that you only use specific CSS code for browsers that support this. Consider, for example, a grid layout or flex-box. These are also the use cases I used the `@ supports` syntax for.

The piece of code below clearly shows how this is used. When display grid is not supported, the main has a 'block' layout. If grid is supported by the browsers, a two column layout is created.

```css
main {
  display: block;
}

@supports (display: grid) {
  main {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
  }
}
```

### **JS Feature detection**

In JavaScript you can use an if statement. By means of the if statement you can see if the element you want to use, such as localStorage, fetch, or something else, is supported in the browser. If not supported, this code will not be executed.

```js
if (window.localStorage) {
  localStorage.setItem('test', 'yes, localStorage exists')
}
```

### **Basic sketches**

Before I started coding, I made a sketch in which the flow of the user should be clear. Based on this I developed my final product.

  ## **Wireflow**
  
  The wireflows are based on the three layers of Progressive Enhancement. The first layer only contains HTML. The second layer consists of HTML & CSS. In the third layer it will be a combination of HTML, CSS & JS.
